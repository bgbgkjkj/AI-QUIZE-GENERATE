Introduction to Python Programming

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

Key Features of Python:
1. Easy to Learn: Python has a simple syntax that mimics natural language, making it beginner-friendly.
2. Interpreted Language: Python code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier.
3. Dynamically Typed: Variables don't need explicit type declarations.
4. Object-Oriented: Supports classes and objects for organizing code.
5. Extensive Libraries: Has a vast standard library and third-party packages.

Data Types in Python:
- Integers (int): Whole numbers like 1, 42, -7
- Floats (float): Decimal numbers like 3.14, -0.5
- Strings (str): Text enclosed in quotes like "Hello"
- Lists (list): Ordered, mutable collections like [1, 2, 3]
- Tuples (tuple): Ordered, immutable collections like (1, 2, 3)
- Dictionaries (dict): Key-value pairs like {"name": "John", "age": 25}
- Sets (set): Unordered collections of unique elements

Control Flow:
- if/elif/else statements for conditional execution
- for loops for iterating over sequences
- while loops for repeated execution
- break and continue for loop control

Functions:
Functions are defined using the 'def' keyword. They can accept parameters and return values.
Example: def greet(name): return f"Hello, {name}!"

Python is widely used in web development, data science, machine learning, automation, and scientific computing.
